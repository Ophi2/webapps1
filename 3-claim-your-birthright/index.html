      <h3>WHAT IS A BLACK MIDI?</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="explanation">
      <p>A black MIDI (invented by Conlon Nancarrow) is an unplayable (usually
remix) of a song. It was invented because Conlon Nancarrow made such complex
compositions, that no pianist could play it. So he purchased a player piano, and
used a hole-punching device of some sort to make his music get played by the pia
no. The reason it's called a <i>BLACK</i> MIDI is because if you look
at sheet music for the song, there are so many notes that it looks completely
black. Nowadays people like

called <a href="https://www.synthesiagame.com/">Synthesia</a> or

to run a digitalized form of BLACK MIDIs.
